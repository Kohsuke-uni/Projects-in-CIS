Installation Instructions

Download Unity Hub Please download and install Unity Hub from the official Unity website. When you start Unity Hub for the first time, you will be asked to log in. If you do not have an account, please create one. https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html

Install Unity 2022.3.55f1 Inside Unity Hub, install Unity Editor version 2022.3.55f1. This version is required because the project was developed and tested using this exact version. Using a different version may cause unexpected behavior. https://unity.com/ja/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.55f1

If Unity requests the installation of Visual Studio or related components during setup, please allow all of them.

Clone the Repository Clone the following GitHub repository to your local machine: https://github.com/Adiiiii117/Software_Design

(Optional but recommended) Install Visual Studio Code for editing and reviewing C# scripts inside the Scripts directory.

Check Out the Correct Branch After cloning, switch to the branch: Tetris-Prototype This branch contains the final version of the project code.

Running Instructions Playing the Game in Unity
Assuming you completed section 1:

Open the Project in Unity Hub In Unity Hub, click Add, then select the folder you cloned. Make sure to open the project using Unity 2022.3.55f1.

Set the Screen Resolution When running the project, set the screen resolution to 1920 × 1080. The UI is optimized specifically for this resolution.

Build Settings Open Build Settings and add all Scenes to the build list. This ensures that scene transitions work correctly.

Once this is complete, the game can be played inside Unity. Please run the Scene named “Title”.

Playing the Packaged Build

If you want to play the packaged version instead of using Unity: please see the attached Tetris Dojo - Build -in.zip This zip contains the packaged builds for both macOS and Windows.

Choose the version that matches your operating system. Launching the executable file will start the game.

Additional Rules and Limitations for This Version

In Normal Mode, pieces lock only when performing a hard drop (S key). There is no auto-lock delay after touching the ground, unlike standard Tetris. This allows players to stack freely without time pressure.

In Easy and Basic modes, the stage resets automatically after a mistake. In Normal and Hard modes, there is no auto-reset. Instead, you can press the → button at the top of the screen to reset manually.

If you press the HOW TO USE button on the title screen, you must press Esc to return to the original menu.

In official Tetris, the "Next" piece is the one at the top of the queue. In this application, the bottom piece in the queue is treated as the next piece.

In TST and TSD Hard Mode, the “Next” display does not appear until after the first piece has been placed.

In REN Mode, clearing 3 REN triggers a success condition. To practice longer REN chains, further updates would be required.

This project was developed using Unity 2022.3.55f1. The game logic and all scripts were written by the development team.

File Structure Overview
The most important folders in this Unity project are:

Assets/ All unique components developed for this game are stored here. For example:

Scripts: Game logic

Scenes: Screen layout and transitions

Prefabs: Definitions of each Tetrimino piece This folder contains all scenes, prefabs, sprites, and C# scripts.

ProjectSettings/ Contains Unity project configurations such as input settings, graphics settings, and editor preferences. Scene transitions and build settings may need to be configured manually when cloned from GitHub, making this folder especially important.

All other files will be generated automatically by Unity when the project is opened.
